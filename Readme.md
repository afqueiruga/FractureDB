## Overview

Modeling the propogation of fracture is an open problem. Generalizing to various classes of materials and propagation modes is likely intractable with traditional analyses.

The hope for this database is to analyze the fine-scale displacement
and stress features around a fracture tip in a standard domain, and learn new
predictive capabilities.
There will be smooth and rough fractures in homogenous and heterogenous media.

This repository contains the codes used to build the databse.
The databases themselves are included in the releases. (See above.)
The databases are simple sqlite3 files, generated with [SimDataDB](https://github.com/afqueiruga/SimDataDB).

Multiple simulation techniques can be used to generate the images.
We don't particularly trust any of them, but we can compare them.
Analysis techniques could potentially fit through the errors by 
looking at the data generated by multiple methods.

## Methodology

The following methods are used:

1. Discretely meshed FEM (Implemented)
2. Phase-field FEM (Need to merge it in)
3. Peridynamics using [PeriFlakes](https://github.com/afqueiruga/PeriFlakes) (untrusted)

The scripts that generated the databases are located in this repo.

- [crack_gen.geo](crack_gen.geo) A gmsh script to mesh a discrete fracture with command line parameters.
- [fem_crack.py](fem_crack.py) Solve a fracture using FEniCS.
- [setup_fenics.sh](setup_fenics.sh) Sets up software for the vanilla FEniCS docker image.

As of this time, the setup is a pressurized fracture with Dirichlet boundary conditions all around---imagine hydraulically fracturing a clamped laboratory sample. As of now only curved single fractures are considered. Branching will be explored soon, as will different boundary conditions.

## Database

The database entries contain the following columns:

1. method - the method used to calculate this entry
2. h - mesh discretization
3. fracture parameters
4. strain energy
5. griffiths fracture energy
5. Fracture volume
6. raw data
7. multichannel downsampled image

The images have the following channels:

1. float - ux
2. float - uy
3. bool - fracture ( 1 fracture, 0 no fracture )
4. float - K bulk modulus (Not yet; uniform K)
5. float - G shear modulus (Not yet; uniform G)

Example entries and queries are in [look_at_results.ipynb](look_at_results.ipynb).

The database is fed into a TensorFlow graph in [importing_in_tensorflow.ipynb](importing_in_tensorflow.ipynb) and used to train a naive model that "predicts" the strain energy from the fracture picture. 
(It's not a very good model: it's just a test of the workflow.)
