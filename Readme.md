# Frature database

## Overview

Modeling the propogation of fracture is an open problem.

The hope for this database is to analyze the fine-scale displacement
and stress features around a fracture tip.

There are smooth and rough fractures in homogenous and heterogenous media.

This repository contains the codes used to build the databse.
The databases themselves are published at Zenodo? DoE db?

Multiple simulation techniques are used to generate the images.
We don't particularly trust any of them, but we can compare them.
Analysis techniques could potentially fit through the errors by 
looking at the data generated by multiple methods.

## Methodology

The following methods are used:

1. Discretely meshed FEM
2. Phase-field FEM
3. Peridynamics using [PeriFlakes](https://github.com/afqueiruga/PeriFlakes) (untrusted)

The scripts are located in this repo.

## Database

The databses can be found at LINK.
The database entries contain the following columns:

1. method - the method used to calculate this entry
2. h - mesh discretization
3. fracture parameters
4. strain energy
5. griffiths fracture energy
6. raw data
7. multichannel downsampled image

The images have the following channels:

1. float - ux
2. float - uy
3. bool - fracture ( 1 fracture, 0 no fracture )
4. float - K bulk modulus
5. float - G shear modulus

Here is an example entry:

SHOW method, h, energy field, then a sequence of images for fields 1-3
